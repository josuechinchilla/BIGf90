Description: Whis package provides R functions to run several BLUPf90 modules. Along with an R function to run K-fold crossvalidation for univariate analyses through blupf90+. 
    The output table from the K-fold crossvalidation function calculates accuracy as cor(y,ebv^) and cor(y*,ebv^) along with bias of ebvs calculated as reg(y,ebv.)
    You will need to create the .par file to feed into Renumf90 manually. Once this is done, there are functions to run Renumf90, Blupf90+, Predictf90, Gibbsf90+ and Postgibbsf90.
    If you need to learn how to use the blupf90 suite of programs refer to nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=start. Please remember to cite Blupf90 appropriately along with this package.
