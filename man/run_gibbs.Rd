\arguments{
\item{path_2_execs}{path to a folder that holds the renumf90 executable. This field should be in quotes "".}

\item{input_files_dir}{path to renf90.par file generated by run_renum function}

\item{output_files_dir}{path to store the result files}

\item{gibbs_iter}{number of samples in the Gibbs sampler.}

\item{gibbs_burn}{number of samples to be discarded at the begining of the Gibbs sampler}

\item{gibbs_keep}{the interval to save samples (thinning). Entering a 1 means all samples are kept.}

\item{verbose}{logical if TRUE prints log information}
}
\description{
This function runs gibbsf90+.
}
\details{
This function runs gibbsf90+ using input from the user and a renf90.par file.
This function is written to use a renf90.par paramererfile, therefore the function run_renumf90 needs to be used beforehand to process a .par file created by the user.
The user will have to enter the number of samples in the MCMC chain, the number of samples to burn and the number used to thin samples. A log file called run_gibbs.log is also produced.
