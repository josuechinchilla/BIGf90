\description{
This function runs predict90.
}
\details{
This function runs predictf90 using a pre-processed parameter file called renf90.par to calculate adjusted phenotypes.
This function is written to use a renf90.par file and a solutions file. Therefore run_renum and run_blup should be ran before using this function.
The output files are be the standard output files produced by predictf90. A log file called run_predict.log is also produced.
