\arguments{
\item{missing_value_code}{code used in the .par file after OPTION MISSING to indicate missing phenotype, if this option is no use, this value must be 0.}

\item{random_effect_col}{Column where random effect is located, found under RANDOM_GROUP in the renf90.par file.}

\item{h2}{estimate of narrow-sense heritabilty.This value is use to calculate accuracy of ebvs}

\item{num_runs}{Number of independent cross-validation runs to be performed.}

\item{num_folds}{Number of folds to be generated within each independent run.}

\item{path_2_execs}{path to a folder that holds all blupf90 executables that ill be used (blupf90+,predictf90). This field should be in quotes "".}

\item{input_files_dir}{directory containing files renf90.par renf90.fields renf90.inb renf90.tables renf90.dat}

\item{output_files_dir}{path to directory to store the output files}

\item{output_table_name}{Name of the final tab-separated out-up file. This field should be in quotes "".}

\item{renf90_ped_name}{Name of pedigree file generated by renumf90. This field should be in quotes "".}

\item{snp_file_name}{the name of the genotype file to be used. If use, this field should be in quotes"". Default for the function is no genotype file.}

\item{seed}{set seed for the stochastic process}

\item{verbose}{logical defining if information will be printed on the console}
}
\value{
a tab-separated file that includes accuracy and bias estimates of ebvs.
}
\description{
This function runs a K-fold cross-validation analysis (CVA) using blupf90 modules.
}
\details{
This function sets up and runs a K-fold cross-validation analysis (CVA) using blupf90+ and predictf90.
The function run_renumf90 needs to be used beforehand to process a .par file created by the user.
This function calculates 2 accuracy estimates: correlation between raw phenotypes and ebvs divided by the square-root of narrow sense heritabilty and correlation between corrected phenotypes and ebvs along with bias estimations calculated as the regression of the phenotypes on the ebvs.
}

## Example for a CVA with 5 independent runs dividing the data in 10 folds.
