\details{
This function cleans and formats the raw solutions file produced by blupf90+ by removing the solutions to all effects other than the random effect (ebvs).
I also matches the processed ID assigned by renumf90 to the original ID for each individual tested producing a interpretable output file with two columns: ID and EBV.
